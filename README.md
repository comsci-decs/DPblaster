## ‚ú® Features

This project is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development. It's a single-page application with no backend dependencies, making it perfect for free hosting on GitHub Pages.

- **Dynamic Sticky Header**: A sleek, "glassmorphism" header that shrinks on scroll for a modern user experience.
- **Frame Selection**: Users can choose between two custom frames (CpE or CS).
- **Dynamic Caption Generation**: Automatically generates a detailed, pre-formatted caption based on user's name and section.
- **Image Upload & Preview**: Allows users to upload a photo from their device and see a live preview.
- **Center & Crop**: Automatically centers and crops non-square images to perfectly fit the 1:1 aspect ratio without stretching or distortion.
- **Client-Side Image Processing**: Merges the uploaded image and the selected frame using the HTML Canvas API.
- **One-Click Download**: Users can download the final framed picture as a `dpblast_profile.png` file.
- **Copy-to-Clipboard**: Easily copy the generated caption with a single button click.
- **Local Visitor Counter**: A simple widget in the footer that tracks page visits on a per-user basis using browser local storage.
- **Fully Responsive**: Designed to work seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Themed UI**: A modern, dark, "techy" theme with a red, orange, and white color palette.
